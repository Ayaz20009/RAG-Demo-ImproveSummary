# Project Title: Retrieval Augmented Generation Using MongoDB Atlas and OpenAI

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by integrating MongoDB Atlas and OpenAI. The primary goal is to retrieve relevant summary sections from stored resumes in a MongoDB collection, enhance them using OpenAI's GPT model, and perform a vector search to improve the quality of a given summary.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.9+** installed with `pip` for package management.
- **MongoDB Atlas** cluster with a `careerServices` database and `resumes` collection.
- **OpenAI API Key** for accessing the GPT and Embedding models.
- Required Python packages installed:
  - `pymongo`
  - `openai`
  - `fitz` (PyMuPDF)
  - `requests`

## Notebook Structure

1. **Introduction (Markdown):** 
   - Brief introduction to the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using MongoDB Atlas and OpenAI.

2. **PDF Preview:**
   - This section previews the PDF document using the IFrame widget.

3. **Summary Extraction:**
   - Extracts the "Summary" section from the resume stored in the PDF format.

4. **Connecting to MongoDB:**
   - Connects to a MongoDB Atlas cluster and accesses the `resumes` collection to retrieve relevant documents.

5. **Convert Summary to Vectors:**
   - Converts the extracted summary into embedding vectors using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model.

6. **Perform Vector Search:**
   - Performs a vector search on the MongoDB collection to retrieve similar summary sections using the generated embedding vectors.

7. **Send Summaries to OpenAI:**
   - Sends the original and retrieved summary sections to OpenAI's GPT-4 for enhancement and improvement.

## Running the Notebook

1. **Set Up MongoDB Connection:**
   - Replace `<MONGODB_CLUSTER_LINK>` in the MongoDB connection cell with your actual MongoDB cluster link.

2. **Set Up OpenAI API Key:**
   - Replace `<OPENAI_API>` in the OpenAI connection cell with your OpenAI API key.

3. **Execute Cells Sequentially:**
   - Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and see the outputs.

## Output

The final output includes:

- The extracted original summary from the resume.
- The improved summary generated by OpenAI is based on influences from other summaries in the MongoDB collection.
